# TODO

- [ ] Add an option to the PendingPlot to allow selecting partition (currently hardcoded to `comp`)
- [ ] Makethe PendingPlot svg scale.  Ideally use a reasonable height when only a short queue, but squish when queue is busy
- [ ] Add some status for cluster.  Similar as to that available from `show_cluster`
- [ ] Better information on FAIR_TREE algorithm and priority
